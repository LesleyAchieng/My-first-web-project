So today I feel excited that I got to do some math.I have since observerd that each morning comes with great power with it and that if my mornings are not blessed and positively spoken to,then possibly I might not acquire what is for that day to befold. 
I wake up each morning most of the time feeling derained and out of energy and I just wake up and go to where I have to go because it is a new day. Sometimes I don't even feel like doing anything.
I know where I am right now is someones else dream even probalby me when I was a kid. I really  want to make the most of my day, doing the things that I love. Teaching people what I have learned and sharing with people my dreams and them sharing what they have in mind.
I know I am not in JKUAT just for the sake of it but I am there for a puporse and even if it is a big school which has a big reputation that does not define me, at the end I will be starting another life and I want that life to be good, my kids going to good schools, not having to depend upon anyone to take my kids to school. Not having to look for schorlaships so that my kid gets to school.
I know sometimes I look at some of the things I learn and think that they are far much beyond my understanding which is true BUT I can learn this things. ENOUGH with me looking down upon myself and what reach I could get if I streched A LITTLE. I am no failure. I am no backward student. I am not lazy. I can achieve my dreams, YES ICAN AND WILL ACHIEVE ,YDREAMS.
