<P style="font-family:courier;">Well sometimes I usually sit back and ask myself. am I really going to do tech or this is a joke! I always feel lone sometimes thinking that before I do something I must have unnique identity and I ought to be like this or that.But i have learnt through reading books and of course listening to my friends that whatever thought I put my mind to will defintly come to pass, that even if thought about the other day it will still come to pass and that I ought to be very carefull with waht I put in my mind. So ya, I want to think positively about this all issue. Aboout me being in Tech Field.</P><br>
<!--another paragraph-->
<P style="font-family:courier;">What I have experienced so far is quite <!--adding italic text formatt--> <i>overwhelming</i>. The people I have met so far, they are so many I can not count. The number of opportunities I have encountered, this is also huge. I want to have more of this. It so pleasing to see how many people I will be able to reach out to through my skills in Technology and also the number of lives that are going to be better each day. It so ill of me to think that I have to be brilliant to be able to do something. It drains me of my energy and also my motivation. Today this day I forgive my self of all the pain and dissapointments I have faced so far, for how I <!--adding bold text formatt--><b>belittle</b> myself and how I ahve been trating myslef all through out.</P><br>
