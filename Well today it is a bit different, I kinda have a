 Well today it is a bit different, I kinda have a feeling that its going to be a day where wisdom id being revealed to me.
 Today I have a feeling that Ihave been struggling to prove to myself that I am a bad girl. Because Itry to find meaning to my life then all if a sudden I keep on hurting myself.
 I watch every step I take, being careful that I do not fall. Everything I do starts at a poitn of fear.
 I do not go out really out there to fully become myself.
 I am looking for myself in books, movies, I admire the person that I know I can really become. I looka t them and admire their courage well I know that I could also be like them, achieving what they have.

 God help me because I think of myself as wise. I want to figure out everything before I do something. If I don't have anything, I look at myself and have pity upon myself not knowing that my God is a LIVING GOD.
 I will make it. I will try to find beauty in all I do.
