       <p >My work is to learn and Grow. What is that again? Yes! Learn and grow. Well I think I will have to explain this. Every day I usually want to learn atleast something new, something that would increase my insight and the way I view life.</p><br>
		<p>I started my journey back in form three, where we had a program called Mombasa Girls In STEM. This program, at first it did not make much sense to me. I said to my self that I will just go through it and see what I would take from this.The program had a thourgh curriculum that ran for 6 months. At frist I could not make much of it because I thought one had to be intelligent to be able to be in this program. Most of the time that really affected me most cause every exercise that was to conducted I always thought that I was not good enough and ya, I shyed away from most activities.</p>
<h3>Where it all started?</h3>
